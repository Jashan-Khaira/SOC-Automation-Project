# SOC-Automation-Project
In this lab, we will explore the practical aspects of setting up a Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab. Our focus will be on understanding and implementing Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) solutions.  We will gain hands-on experience with real-world scenarios, enhancing our skills as SOC analysts.
